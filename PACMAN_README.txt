Pacman: The New Age

This is a C++ program that implements a simplified game of Pacman. 

The program is a multi-player, user-interactive game that uses a GUI to show a world where the main character, Pac-Man, travels around the maze trying to eat all of the dots before his enemy, the Ghost, catches him. To successfully win this game, Pac-Man must eat all of the dots in the maze without being caught by his opponent; in the event he collides with the Ghost, the game is over and the player loses. In the normal version of Pac-Man, if a larger powerup circle is eaten, then Pac-Man can turn the tables and eat the ghosts, sending them back to their home at the center of the maze. However, in our simplified version of the game, there are no powerups and there is only one map to play. 

All files necessary to run the game are included. To play, the user needs only to:
1. Download the provided .zip files to a known location in their drive
2. Open the .sln in Microsoft Visual Studio
3. Run the program

When prompted to begin the game, the user should press the space bar and use the keyboard keys "w”, "a", "s", and "d" to move the yellow Pacman character up, left, down, and right, respectively. The Ghost similarly moves up, left, down, and right with the corresponding arrow keys on the keyboard. If the user successfully maneuvers their Pac-Man to consume all of the dots in the maze without running into the Ghost, then the program will present them with a victory screen to let them know they have completed the game. If the user lets their Pac-Man die at any point during the game, the game stops, and the program will let the user know that they have lost. To play again, the user can simply press the ‘r’ key to restart or manually rerun the program from inside Visual Studio.

If the user wishes to modify any part of the game, they are able to go into the respective files and update the number of characters (Pac-Man, Ghosts, etc.) present in the maze, change the grid layout, alter the difficulty of the game, add multiple lives for Pacman, etc.
